# Game-of-Game-of-Life
This is a Conway's game of life simulator. At the moment it is pretty basic but I hope to impliment:
 - A 2-Player VS mode
 - Different types of cell
as well as some improvements to the simulator overall.


Controls are as follows:
  - LEFT CLICK to make a cell "alive".
  - RIGHT CLICK to kill a cell.
  - Press SPACE to pause/unpause the game.
  - Press RIGHT Arrow to move forward a single turn when paused.
  - Press ENTER to clear the board.
  - Presets (Press the corresponding number to place one):
    - 1 - Glider
    - 2 - Small Exploder
    - 3 - Exploder
    - 4 - Light Weight Space Ship
    - 5 - Tumbler
    - 6 - Gosper Glider Gun
    - 7 - Pentadecathlon
    - 8 - r-Pentomino
- Press ESC to exit to the main menu.
