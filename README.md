# Game-of-Game-of-Life
This is a Conway's game of life simulator. At the moment it is pretty basic but I hope to impliment:
 - A 2-Player VS mode
 - Different types of cell
as well as some improvements to the simulator overall, eg. preset patterns and a slider for the user to determine the FPS.

Controls are as follows:
  - LEFT CLICK to make a Board "alive".
  - RIGHT CLICK to Kill a cell.
  - Press SPACE to pause/unpause the game.
  - Press RIGHT Arrow to move forward a turn when paused.
  - Press ENTER to clear the board.
  - Presets (Press the corresponding number to place one):
  - - 1-Glider
  - - 2-Small Exploder
  - - 3-Exploder
  - - 4-Pentadecathlon
  - - 4-Light Weight Space Ship
  - - 5-Tumbler
  - - 6-Gosper Glider Gun
  - - 7-Pentadecathlon
  - Press ESC to exit the window.
