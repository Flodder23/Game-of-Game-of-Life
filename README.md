# Game-of-Game-of-Life
This is a Conway's game of life simulator. At the moment it is pretty basic but I hpoe to impliment:
 A 2-PLAYER vs mode
 Different types of cell
as well as some improvements to the simulator overall, eg. preset patterns and a slider for the user to determine the FPS.

controls are as follows:
  LEFT CLICK to make a Board "alive".
  RIGHT CLICK to Kill a cell.
  Press SPACE to pause/unpause the game.
  Press ENTER to clear the board.
  When paused, click RIGHT ARROW to go forward one turn.
  Presets (Press the corresponding number to place one):
    1-Glider
    2-Small Exploder
    3-Exploder
    4-Pentadecathlon
    5-Light Weight Space Ship
