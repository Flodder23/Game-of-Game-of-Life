# Game-of-Game-of-Life
This is a Conway's game of life simulator. At the moment it is pretty basic but I hpoe to impliment:
 A 2-PLAYER vs mode
 Different types of cell
as well as some improvements to the simulator overall, eg. preset patterns and a slider for the user to determine the FPS.

controls are as follows:
  LEFT CLICK to make a Board "alive".\n
  RIGHT CLICK to Kill a cell.\n
  Press SPACE to pause/unpause the game.\n
  When paused, click RIGHT ARROW to go forward one turn.
